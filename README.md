# ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project hosted on AWS S3 !

## Simple Project hosted on AWS S3
#### Note: Since it was a hands-on project, the object(file)that was added to the s3 bucket is deleted after the succesful deplyoment thus the URL is currently inactive.

>This project demonstrates a basic setup for hosting a static website on AWS S3. 
The project consists of a single index.html file that serves as the main webpage.
```
 Clone the repository (if using locally) using bash commands:
https://github.com/vishu8844/vishu-aws-S3-Bucket-Project.git
```
Upload index.html to your S3 Bucket
```
1.Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2.Navigate to the S3 service.
3.Create a new bucket or use an existing one.
4.Upload the index.html file to the root of your S3 bucket.
5.Set Permissions:
Optionally, set the permissions of your S3 bucket or the index.html file to be publicly accessible.
This allows anyone to view your website.
```
Enable Static Website Hosting:
>In the S3 Management Console, select your bucket. Click on "Static website hosting" and choose "Use this bucket to host a website".
